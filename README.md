# WebScraping

WebScraping is a repository I created to store scripts I created for web scraping.

Web scraping: "a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis" - Wikipedia

intro.py - intro webscraping project that takes 3 command line arguments: 
a business type (eg. restaurant, gym) - searches yelp for this type of business
a city (eg. Bloomington) - searches yelp in this specific location
a state (eg. IN, Indiana) - searches yelp in this broader location
