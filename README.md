# WebScraping

WebScraping is a repository I created to store scripts I created for web scraping.

Web scraping: "a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis" - Wikipedia

intro.py - intro webscraping project that takes 2 command line arguments: 
a business type (eg. restaurant, gym) - searches yelp for this type of business
a location (eg. Bloomington) - searches yelp in this specific location

    to enter a two word location or business type, use the + symbol to separate the words (eg. apple+orchard, bloomington+in)

intro.py outputs SQL file with enteredbusiness_enteredlocation.sql

there are several example outputs with apple orchards and restaurants in various locations
